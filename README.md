# FFTerm

Play media in the terminal (stdout).

The name was inspired by FFmpeg, but this project is unrelated to it.

## Install

FFTerm is distributed on PyPI:

`pip install ffterm`

## Usage

`ffterm /path/to/video.mp4`

`ffterm /path/to/image.jpg`

There may be errors if the terminal size is too large.
